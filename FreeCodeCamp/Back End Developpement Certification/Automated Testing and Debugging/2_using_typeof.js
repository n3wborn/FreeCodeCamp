 * You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable.
 *
 * Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.
 *
 * Try using typeof on each of the following to see which types they have.
 *
 *  console.log(typeof "");
 *  console.log(typeof 0);
 *  console.log(typeof []);
 *  console.log(typeof {});
